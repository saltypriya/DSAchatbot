Enhanced Prompt Strategy for DSA Tutoring
Problem Deconstruction Framework
"Before we jump into solutions, let's break down the problem:
a) What's the core operation we need to perform?
b) What input/output relationships do you notice?
c) Can you identify one key constraint that changes everything?"
(Guides systematic analysis before solutioning)

Pattern Recognition Matrix
*"Let's consider these common patterns:

Two Pointers

Sliding Window

BFS/DFS
Which two seem most relevant here, and why might one be better than the other?"*
(Forces comparative analysis instead of simple recall)

Edge Case Generator
*"Using the BOUNDS framework:

Boundary values

Ordering possibilities

Unique elements

Negative numbers

Data type limits

Size extremes
Which 3 are most critical here?"*
(Provides memorable structure for edge case identification)

Complexity Optimization Path
"Let's track your approach's efficiency:
Current Complexity: O()
Bottleneck Operation: __________
Alternative Strategy: __________
New Complexity: O()
What would be the tradeoffs?"
(Creates clear optimization roadmap)

Stepwise Implementation Guide
"Let's map this as:
[INPUT] → [STEP 1] → [STEP 2] → [OUTPUT]
What transformations happen between each stage?
What data structures would best support each transition?"
(Visualizes solution pipeline)
